SOLUTION: Install Rust (https://rustup.rs/) and GFortran

PROBLEM: "COBOL compilation failed"
SOLUTION: Run build.sh first, check compiler error messages

PROBLEM: "Fortran compilation failed"
SOLUTION: Verify GFortran installed (gfortran --version)

PROBLEM: "Test execution failed"
SOLUTION: Review test log in test_results/end_to_end_test_*.log

PROBLEM: "Some tests failed validation"
SOLUTION: DO NOT deploy. Fix issues and rerun until 100% pass rate.
