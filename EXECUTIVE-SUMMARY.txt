  Subject: Reduce COBOL Migration Costs by 90% - No Upfront Fees

  Dear [IT Director],

  I noticed [Bank Name] has legacy COBOL systems. I've developed a
  compiler that automatically converts COBOL to Fortran with:

  • 90-95% COBOL coverage
  • Zero floating-point errors (critical for banking)
  • Enterprise audit trail
  • 6% revenue share (no upfront fees)

  Typical manual rewrite: $5M-$20M
  With Corn Compiler: ~$300K-$1.2M (6% of savings)
  Savings: $4.7M-$18.8M

  Can we schedule a 30-minute demo?

  Best regards,

  - Show live compilation with banking_test_suite.cob
  - Demonstrate precision arithmetic (no errors)
  - Show audit trail and compliance features
  - Present ROI analysis (see COMMERCIAL-OVERVIEW.txt)

STEP 4: PILOT
  - Offer 90-day pilot project
  - Convert 3-5 representative COBOL programs
  - Validate results side-by-side
  - Document success

STEP 5: CONTRACT
  - Sign commercial license (6% revenue)
  - Execute deployment (see ENTERPRISE-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.txt)
  - Provide ongoing support
  - Collect quarterly revenue payments

STEP 6: SCALE
  - Use pilot as case study
  - Market to additional customers
  - Target 10 customers in Year 1

  5 customers × $300K/year = $1.5M Year 1 revenue
  Your profit: ~$1.2M (after expenses)

TARGET (10 customers in Year 1):
  10 customers × $600K/year = $6M Year 1 revenue
  Your profit: ~$5M (after expenses)

OPTIMISTIC (20 customers in Year 1):
  20 customers × $600K/year = $12M Year 1 revenue
  Your profit: ~$10M (after expenses)

YEAR 2-3 POTENTIAL:
  As customer base grows: $20M-$50M annual revenue

With successful execution, this could be a $50M+ business.
