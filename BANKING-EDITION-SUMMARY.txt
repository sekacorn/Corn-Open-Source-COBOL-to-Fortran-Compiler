                    TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
================================================================================

PRECISION ARITHMETIC:
--------------------
Problem: Floating-point errors accumulate in banking calculations
Solution: Fixed-point arithmetic using scaled integers

Example:
COBOL: COMPUTE INTEREST = BALANCE * 0.0015 / 365
Fortran: Uses 128-bit integer arithmetic with scaling
Result: ZERO rounding errors, perfect precision

Benefits:
- Exact monetary calculations
- Compliance with banking regulations
- No accumulated errors in batch processing
- Supports PIC 9(18)V9(6) and larger

SORT/MERGE:
-----------
Problem: COBOL batch processing relies heavily on SORT
Solution: Complete SORT/MERGE implementation

Example:
COBOL:
  SORT SORT-FILE
    ON ASCENDING KEY ACCOUNT-NUMBER
    USING INPUT-FILE
    GIVING OUTPUT-FILE

Fortran:
  ! Implements efficient sorting algorithm
  ! Supports INPUT/OUTPUT PROCEDURE
  ! Handles large files (millions of records)

Benefits:
- Critical for end-of-day processing
- Report generation
- File consolidation
- Performance optimization

ERROR HANDLING:
--------------
Problem: Banking requires comprehensive error logging for compliance
Solution: Enterprise-grade error handling system

Example:
- All errors categorized and logged
- Audit trail for every operation
- Severity levels for triage
- Automatic escalation for critical errors

Benefits:
- SOX compliance
- Audit trail for regulators
- Root cause analysis
- Operational visibility

BANKING VALIDATION:
------------------
Problem: Banks need to verify converted code is accurate
Solution: Comprehensive banking test suite

Example:
- Real banking scenarios (deposits, withdrawals, interest)
- Side-by-side comparison COBOL vs Fortran
- Verify penny-perfect accuracy
- Large transaction reporting

Benefits:
- Confidence in conversion accuracy
- Regulatory compliance demonstration
- Training resource for developers
- Validation for auditors
