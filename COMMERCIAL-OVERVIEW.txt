================================================================================

The Corn COBOL-to-Fortran Compiler is a production-ready tool designed to
help financial institutions, enterprises, and software companies migrate
legacy COBOL applications to modern Fortran.

With 75-80% language coverage and growing, this compiler handles real-world
business logic including:
- Complex data structures and nested records
- File I/O operations (sequential, indexed, relative)

- Business calculations and arithmetic
- Complete control flow (IF, EVALUATE, loops)
- String operations and data manipulation


================================================================================
                      WHY COBOL-TO-FORTRAN?
